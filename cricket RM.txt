This is a simple Python-based cricket score simulator where two teams take turns to play their innings.  
Features

→ Each team has 20 balls and a maximum of 10 wickets.
→ Only 0 to 6 runs are allowed per ball.
→ Displays when a player is out.
→ Announces Team A Wins,Team B Wins, or Draw based on final scores.

Working
1. Team A bats first.  
   → For each ball, the user enters either:
   → A number (0–6) for runs, or  
   →`"o"` or `"out"` if the player is out.
2. When all 20 balls are used or 10 wickets fall, Team A’s score is saved.
3. Team B then bats under the same rules.
4. The program compares both scores and prints the match result.
